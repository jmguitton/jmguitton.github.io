		<p> 
		My name is Jack Guitton and I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia"> Augusta, Georgia</a>. I was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1997 and moved to Augusta at about the age of six! I attended the Academy of Richmond County before starting my freshman year at the University of Georgia in the fall of 2015. In my free time, I like to play tennis and spend time with friends. One of my favorite things to do in my free time is to play tennis. My grandfather played tennis at the University of Tennessee and introduced me to the game at a very young age. In high school I played varsity tennis and worked at a local tennis club giving lessons to younger less experienced players. Other than tennis, I like to play golf with my dad and spend time with family when I am not doing work for school.

		One fun fact about me is that I am very tall. Wherever I go, people always ask me how tall I am or if I play basketball. I do not play much basketball but I get asked so much that I sometimes just lie and tell people I play on the UGA team just for fun. I am six feet and six inches tall which makes it very believable to people that I play for a college team. I once kept a record of how many times per week someone made a comment about my height. The highest number I ever recorded in one week was 12!

		I am currently an intended risk management and insurance major but am very interested in the exploring the other majors that the Terry College has to offer. Both of my parents work in the medical field and my two sisters are also on the path to careers in medicine. I do not know exactly what it is I want to do with a business degree in the future but I have already learned a lot in just my first year at UGA and look forward to learning more.
